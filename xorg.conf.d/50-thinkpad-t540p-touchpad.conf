# This configuration file is written for the clickpad on the ThinkPad
# T540p. It shrinks the left and right edges so you don't have to
# choose between carpal tunnel syndrome and the cursor jumping goddamn
# everywhere. It also shrinks the top and bottom edges so you can
# click without the cursor floating wildly all over the
# place. Finally, it sets software button areas so you don't have
# twelve square inches of left clickable space, two square centimeters
# of right clickable space, and no middle mouse button whatsoever.
